He RACES down NARROW DUNKIRK STREETS. BREATHING. Kit JANGLING... building after building... he rounds a corner-
BLAM! Bullets hit dirt and bricks near him- the street ahead is barricaded, manned by FRENCH TROOPS-
TOMMY ANGLAIS! ANGLAIS!
The French stop firing and wave him through.
He SCRAMBLES over their sandbag barricade, taking in their dirty, frightened faces as he passes...
A FRENCH SOLDIER grabs him-
FRENCH SOLDIER Allez, Anglais.
Tommy's mouth opens at the man's BITTERNESS.
FRENCH SOLDIER (contempt) (CONT'D)

The LONGEST, WIDEST BEACH he's ever seen, sunlight DAZZLING off the water-
Endless dark FENCES snaking across the sand and out into the water-
Tommy SQUINTS- not fences- lines of MEN- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN...
Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach. He CLAMBERS over a dune, FEVERISHLY undoing his belt, dropping trousers and SQUATTING before he realizes-
He's not alone-
Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with the labour of BURYING A BODY. This is GIBSON.
The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses. Tommy finishes, pulls up his trousers and moves towards him.

Tommy helps scoop sand over the body.
Tommy notices the corpse's STOCKINGED FEET, then watches Gibson stoop to TIE HIS BOOTS...
Gibson looks up at him. Tommy shrugs, gestures for Gibson's water can. Gibson hands it over and Tommy takes a SWIG, carefully CATCHING drops in his hand, then LICKING them off his palm.
Tommy leaves Gibson buttoning his shirt and heads back onto the beach.
There are DESTROYERS out on the water, too far to reach.
Tommy wanders down to join one of the long, snaking lines which extends into the sea, soldiers up to their CHESTS in water, WAITING PATIENTLY FOR SHIPS WHICH DO NOT MOVE.
The man at the back turns to Tommy, unwelcoming. Points at his own insignia.
MAN Grenadiers, Mate.
Tommy moves off. Looks around at other impossibly long lines. At the unattainable ships. Futile.
A line of STRETCHER BEARERS comes past, carrying wounded men along the beach towards the harbour...
Looking where they're headed, Tommy sees a LONG, NARROW BREAKWATER extending out into the sea, packed with soldiers. A HOSPITAL SHIP at the end of it.
This breakwater extends a kilometer into the sea. It is called THE MOLE.

 Tommy becomes aware of the sound of DISTANT AIRCRAFT. Soldiers peer up into the sky...

Tommy spots the distinctive KINKED WINGS of the notorious STUKA DIVE BOMBER- its NIGHTMARISH HOWL RISING as it picks up speed, DIVING at the beach...

Tommy sees a soldier lying ON HIS BACK, RIFLE AIMED AT THE SKY, FIRING DEFIANTLY, DESPERATELY at the attacking plane... the ground around him LIFTS into the air with the second wave of bombs.
Tommy buries his face in the sand as the bombs BLAST AND BLAST AND BLAST-
The explosions stop. Tommy lifts his head. BOOM- ANOTHER WAVE OF BOMBS EXPLODES IN SERIES UP THE BEACH. Then, finally, quiet. Tommy rises...
The stretcher bearers, back on their feet, lift their burdens (four bearers per stretcher, one at each corner).
Several stretchers are left behind on the sand.
Soldiers on the beach watch in despair as one of the DESTROYERS is slipping below the water, smoke billowing.

COLLINS
40 gallons, Fortis 1. over.

51 INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS 51 Farrier instinctively looks at his gauge. Nothing.
FARRIER
40 gallons, understood.
Farrier pulls out a grease pencil and notes fuel and time.
FARRIER (CONT'D)
We're about five minutes out- climb
to 2,000.
COLLINS (over radio) That's more fuel.
FARRIER
I don't want to get jumped again.
Get some altitude, dive down on the bastards. Over.

Commander Bolton looks over at the wet soldiers clinging to the understructure of the mole.
COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.) Right, Highlanders. Let's find you
another ship.
The wet soldiers pull themselves to their feet...
Tommy, watched by Alex, SLIPS into the water, then pulls himself out, dripping. Gibson follows suit. Alex LAUGHS at them... then helps them push into the group...
They follow the wet soldiers up onto the mole, where Bolton's men shepherd them onto a LAUNCH.
54 EXT. LAUNCH - CONTINUOUS 54
Tommy and Gibson make themselves inconspicuous amongst the Highlanders, eyes down.

The launch motors out of the harbour.
It approaches a DESTROYER, its sheer iron side TOWERING above the launch, as it BOBS up and down alongside.
CARGO NETS are dropped over the side, and the men start to step up onto the rail of the BOBBING ship, waiting for the RHYTHMIC movement towards the iron wall- GRABBING at the rope mesh, STRUGGLING to pull themselves up.
Tommy steps up to the railing, next to an EXHAUSTED soldier who can barely lift himself up- Tommy grabs his shoulder to steady him on the rail as the launch BOUNCES off the iron wall of the destroyer-
They both grab at the net, Tommy climbing up-
The exhausted soldier has not got his feet into the netting, he slips lower...
The gap between the launch and the destroyer shrinks to nothing-
The soldier's legs are CRUSHED between the two oblivious craft-
He SCREAMS- hands PULL him up as the craft separate...
55 EXT. DESTROYER - CONTINUOUS 55
The men collapse onto the deck in exhausted piles. SAILORS and NURSES urge them to move below decks.
SAILOR
Down below. Come on, mate-
Tommy follows Alex and his mates to a doorway at the head of the stairs down below. A NURSE is standing there.
NURSE
Come on, boys. There's a nice cup
of tea for you down there. This way, come on.

Down below, Tommy and Alex eat and drink hungrily and gratefully. Between bites, Alex gestures to the stairs.
ALEX
What's wrong with your friend?
Tommy WATCHES THE DOOR TO THE HOLD CLOSE. Takes another bite. Uneasy.
Looks around the hold, PACKED LIKE THE TUBE AT RUSH HOUR.
TOMMY
Looking for a quick way out. In
case we go down.
Tommy and Alex edge through the crowd towards the stairs...

The Shivering Soldier glances up. REALIZES SOMETHING...
SHIVERING SOLDIER Where are we going?
MR.DAWSON
Dunkirk.
SHIVERING SOLDIER No, we're going to England!
MR.DAWSON
We have to go to Dunkirk first.
SHIVERING SOLDIER I'M NOT GOING BACK!
Peter watches from the companionway. The Shivering Soldier throws his arm out at the dark cloud on the horizon-

Peter shuts the door. Looks at the bolt. Considering.
61 EXT. MOONSTONE - CONTINUOUS 61
George looks up at the Commander. Addresses him with the tone of a child trying to speak like a grown up...
GEORGE Is he a coward?
Mr.Dawson looks sharply at George.
MR.DAWSON
He's shell-shocked, George. He's
not himself. He may never be himself again.
62 INT. CABIN, MOONSTONE - MOMENTS LATER 62
Peter hands the Shivering Soldier a cup of tea. The Shivering Soldier accepts it wordlessly. Staring in front of him. Peter closes the forepeak door. Pauses.
Peter gently slides the bolt, LOCKING THE DOOR.

Farrier has the Heinkel in his sights, bucking and weaving
as his spitfire SLICES down through turbulent air... he pushes the button on the stick which control his guns...
He ROLLS away from the Heinkel as he dives beneath it, taking his finger off the trigger, fighting the g's with his neck as he pulls out of the dive...
67 INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS 67
Collins fires at one of the 109's until he sees SMOKE trailing- he DIVES between the German planes...
68 INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - CONTINUOUS 68
Farrier SCANS his surroundings as he tries to orient himself relative to the Heinkel...
Finding it, he pulls the stick, lining up for another run at it, this time from below...
The bomber is in his sights- he fires his guns...
He flashes past- dangerously close to its top turret which HURLS TRACER BULLETS at him- he sees SPARKING on the hull of the bomber-
69 INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 2 - CONTINUOUS 69

SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.) You haven't turned around!
Mr.Dawson turns calmly to the Shivering Soldier.
MR.DAWSON No. We have a job to do.
SHIVERING SOLDIER Job? This is a pleasure yacht!
You're weekend sailors, not the bloody navy-! A man your age-
MR.DAWSON
Men my age dictate this war. Why

The men start rowing.
Gibson is in the back. Alex SPOTS him.
Gibson quietly drops the rear painter (a small rope attached to the stern) into the black water.
Alex takes it, hands part of it to Tommy and they quietly drag behind the boat as it rows in to the shore... the men in the rear notice, but nobody says anything...

TOMMY Don't be daft.
Alex stares Gibson down...
ALEX
He's a bloody jerry. You might not've

'Gibson' just stares.
TOMMY
He did. I helped him- I thought it

ALEX Maybe he killed him-
TOMMY He didn't kill him-
ALEX How do we know?!
TOMMY
How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach, for God's sake?! He didn't kill anyone- he was looking for a way off the damned sand like the rest of us!

COMMANDER BOLTON

                     (they nod)
Mind the current at the mouth, boys.

Commander Bolton turns to see the STUKA approaching, its distinctive kinked-wing silhouette bearing down like an AWFUL BIRD OF PREY...
The soldiers stir, some crouching, some closing their eyes. Commander Bolton takes a knee, BRACING. He bites his lip as the STUKA goes into its dive, that TERRIBLE WHINE BUILDING...

he'd see us through.
Mr.Dawson moves forward. Collins steps up

Soldier after soldier climbs out of the yacht. The CORPORAL handing out travel chits marvels at the absurd amount...
CORPORAL
How many you got in there?
The Shivering Soldier is taken ashore, wrapped in blankets.
Tommy and Alex stick together as they are handed hot cups of tea and shepherded out of the harbour in long lines.
Peter supervises as George's body is taken ashore.
As Collins steps off the boat a soldier from another boat spots his RAF uniform-
                             SOLDIER

179 EXT. WEYMOUTH RAIL YARD - NIGHT 179
Tommy and Alex, exhausted, downcast, are herded across the tracks towards a train. Before getting on they are handed a BLANKET and cup of tea by an ELDERLY MAN, who looks at their hands not their faces as he hands the rough blanket over-
ELDERLY MAN
...well done, lads... well done,
lads...
ALEX
All we did is survive.
ELDERLY MAN
That's enough. Well, done, lads,

COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT'D) I know we're officers, but it's us
or the enemy, so now's not the time to be particular...
The Private scrambles down into the launch, where Colonel Winnant stands talking to Commander Bolton.
They look out at the vast deserted beach, littered with corpses and abandoned equipment...
COLONEL WINNANT (to Commander Bolton)
Churchill got his 30 thousand.
COMMANDER BOLTON
And then some. Almost three hundred
thousand. So far.
Commander Bolton steps back up onto the mole.
So far?
COLONEL WINNANT

I'm staying. (off look)
For the French.
The Launch pulls away from Commander Bolton on the mole.

The boy pulls the paper off the top and stretches up to hand it to Alex. Alex slumps into his seat, the headline:
"CHURCHILL ADDRESSES DUNKIRK EVACUATION IN COMMONS"
Alex thrusts the paper at Tommy.
ALEX (CONT'D)
I can't bear it. You read it.
