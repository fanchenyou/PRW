                 "Can she bake a cherry pie."


EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Yes?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          I heard you had a game?



                    DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Who are you?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          They call me Bill.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Bill what?



                    BILL (O.S.)
          That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Open the door Alburt, let's see
          what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



                       L.F. O'BOYLE
             Are you a policeman, Bill?



                       BILL
             Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



                       L.F.
             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



                       L.F.
                 (to the players)
             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



                       ALBURT
             I'll take that.



                       BILL
             You'll have to.

The two men stare...



                       L.F.
             Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
             intend to start any shit with that
             sword?



                       BILL
             I give you my word of honor, I will
             start nothing.

                    L.F.
          Good enough for me.
              (back to game)



                    ALBURT
          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



                    BILL
          That's rather pricey.



                    ALBURT
          You wanna play for free, go to
          Vegas. You start now you'll be
          there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



                    BILL
          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



                      ALBURT
          That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



                      BILL
          Beer.



                    BARTENDER
          Twenty dollars.



                    BILL
          Twenty dollars for a beer?



                    BARTENDER
          High cost of living shooter. You
          don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

          get a prime rib dinner there for
          3.95.



                    BILL
          What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
              (throws a 20 on the bar)
          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



                    BILL
              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



                    BILL
          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



                    L.F.
          Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
          in school wants    to play right away.
              (to Bill)
          How bout it new    kid, you wanna
          handle my bones,    or do you just
          like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



                    BILL
          I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



                    L.F.
          Boys take a look at this man, he's
          what Webster's calls, a gambler.
          The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

                    L.F.
          I hope you're not implying
          anything, friend?



                    BILL
              (as he inspects dice)
          I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



                    ALBURT
          That did it fuckhead, you're out
          the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



                    BILL
          You looked me over when I stood in
          your doorway. I'm looking you over
          as I step up to your table. If I
          don't know, I don't throw.



                    L.F.
          Are you satisfied?



                    BILL
          More or less.



                    L.F.
          I think we're getting into a
          antagonistic relationship.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
          trying to take my money, and I was
          trying to take yours.

                    L.F.
          It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



                     BILL
          If you're game, take my bet
          sportsman.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



                    L.F.
          The point is five, gentlemen, five
          is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                    L.F.
          Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



                    BILL
          Play a game of luck long enough
          you're bound to meet some lucky
          people.



                    L.F.
          You know we've never been properly
          introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



                    BILL
          And I'm not interested.



                    L.F.
          No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
          boy, I'm only trying to be
          friendly.



                    BILL
          I didn't come here to make friends.
          I came here to shoot a little crap.
          But then your boy over there hits
          me up for a two hundred dollar
          privilege to play fee --



                    L.F.
          -- That's a membership fee, good
          for --



                    BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



          L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



             BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



          L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



          BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



          L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



             BILL

          Oooohhh, that's....



                    L.F.
          The house's perogative and you know
          it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



                    L.F.
          Maybe you would like to change your
          bet?



                    BILL
          Yes I would.....Shoot it
          all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



                     L.F.
          What?



                    BILL
          Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
          I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



                    ALBURT
          You can't do that.



                    BILL
          Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
          perogative, and she knows it.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



                    BILL
          Can I use your phone?



                    L.F.
          Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



                    L.F.
          Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
          out! No more tonight, go home....



                    BILL
              (into phone)
          Vernita's dead? When?
              (pause)
          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
          completely apeshit. No idea where
          she is?
              (pause)
          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



                    BILL
          We're going to have a talk about
          this later.
              (pause)

          Well, I'm not exactly among friends
          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



                    BILL
          Got a nose problem?



                    L.F.
          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



                    BILL
          This is true.



                    L.F.
          You didn't burn me down you know?



                     BILL
          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



                     L.F.
          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



                    BILL
          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



                       L.F.
             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



                    BILL
          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



                    BILL
          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE CARD:


                        Chapter seven

                     "The lonely grave of
                        Paula Schultz"



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia
          obligation.



                    BILL
          How ya doin' Budd?



                    BUDD
          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



                    BUDD
          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



                    BILL
          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



                    BUDD
          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



                    BUDD
          What'd ya wanna talk about?



                    BILL
          Are you not going to invite me in?



                    BUDD
          No.



                    BILL
          May I ask why not?



                    BUDD
          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

                                                TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



                    BUDD
          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



                    BILL
          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



                    BUDD
          Why.



                    BILL

          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



                    BUDD
          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



                    BILL
          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



                    BUDD
          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



                    BILL
          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



                    BUDD
          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



                    BILL
              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



                    BUDD
          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



                    BILL
          You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

                    BUDD
          Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



                    BILL
          It was priceless.



                    BUDD
          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



                    BILL
          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



                    BUDD
          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



                    BILL
          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

                       BILL
             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



                       BUDD
             And what would that happy side be?



                       BILL
             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



                       BUDD
             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



                       TED
             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



                       STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd.



                    BUDD
          Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



                    STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.



                    BUDD
          I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



                       THE BRIDE
          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



                     BUDD
           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



                     BUDD

          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



                    BUDD
          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



                    BUDD
          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



                    BUDD
          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



                      ELLE
          Bill?



                    BUDD
          Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



                      ELLE
          ....Budd?



                      BUDD
          Bingo.



                    ELLE
          And what do I owe this dubious
          pleasure?



                    BUDD
          I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
          never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



                    ELLE
          Do you mean what I think you mean?



                    BUDD
          If you think I mean I got 'er, you
          thought right.

                    ELLE
          Did you kill her?



                    BUDD
          Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
          it easy enough. She's so gentle
          right now, I could preform her coup
          de grace with a rock.



                    ELLE
          What are you waiting for, run outta
          liquid courage.



                    BUDD
          No. It's just...I ain't killed
          nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
          just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
          Christ, kinda made me a promise I
          wasn't gonna. Be that however it
          is. Back when I did kill people...I
          got paid for it. Just don't seem
          right...turn amateur this time of
          life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



                    BUDD (O.S.)
          Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
          hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



                    BUDD
          A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
          sword. And I'm here to tell ya
          Elle, that's what I call sharp.



                      ELLE
          How much?



                    BUDD
          Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
          priceless and all.

          ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



          BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



          ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



          BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



          ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



          BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



          ELLE
What's the terms?



          BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



          ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          You kill her tonight.
              (pause)
          And one more thing.



                    BUDD
          You said one condition.



                     ELLE
          It's a caveat to the same
          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          She must suffer to her last breath.



                    BUDD
          That Elle darlin, I can pretty
          damwell guarantee.



                    ELLE
          Then I'll see you in the morning
          millionaire.

                                                 CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



                    BUDD
          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
              (ENGLISH)
          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



                    BUDD
          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



                    BUDD
          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

                       BUDD
          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



                    BUDD
          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



                        THE BRIDE
             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

                     THE BRIDE
          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



                    BUDD
              (into phone)
          Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



                       ELLE
             Didja do it?



                       BUDD
             Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
             speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

                        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



                       BILL (V.O.)
             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
          ...head priest of The White Lotus
          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
          road, contemplating whatever a man
          with Pai Mei's infinite power would
          contemplate -- Which is another way
          of saying, who knows. When, a
          Shaolin monk appeared on the road
          traveling in the opposite
          direction. As the monk and the
          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
          in a practically unfathomable
          display of generosity, gave the
          monk the slightest of nods. The
          nod, was not returned. Was it the
          intention of the Shaolin monk to
          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
          fail to see the generous social
          gesture?
          The motives of the monk, remain,
          unknown. What is known, were the
          consequences. The next morning Pai
          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
          and demanded that the temple's head
          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
          repay the insult. The Abbot, at
          first, tried to console Pai Mei,
          only to find, Pai Mei was
          inconsolable. So began, the
          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
          all sixty of the monks inside, at
          the fists of the White Lotus. And
          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
          Technique.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
          exploding heart technique?



                    BILL (V.O.)
          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
          all of the martial arts. He hits
          you with his fingertips, at ten
          different pressure points on your
          body. And then, he lets you walk
          away. But once you've taken five
          steps, your heart explodes inside
          your body, and you fall to the
          floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



                    THE BRIDE
          Did he teach you that?



                    BILL
          No. He teaches no one the ten-point
          palm - exploding heart technique.
          But he is Nietzsche's psalm
          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
          kill you, he will make you
          stronger. Now one of the things I
          always liked about you, Kiddo, is
          you appear wise beyond your years.
          Then allow me to impart, a word to
          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
          him - even for an instant - a
          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
          And if you throw any American sass
          his way, he will snap your back and
          your neck like they were twigs, and
          that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



                    BILL
          He'll accept you as his student.

                    THE BRIDE
          Caught him in a good mood, aye?



                    BILL
          More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



                    BILL
          Just seeing those steps again makes
          me ache. You're gonna have plenty
          of fun carrying buckets of water up
          and down that fucker.



                    THE BRIDE
          Why did he accept me?



                    BILL
          Because he's a very very very old
          man. And like all rotten bastards,
          when they get old, they become
          lonely. Not that that has any
          effect on their disposition. But
          they do learn the value of company.



                    THE BRIDE
          When will I see you again?



                    BILL
          That's the title of my favorite
          soul song of the Seventies.



                    THE BRIDE
          What?



                    BILL
          Nothing. When he tells me you're
          done.

                    THE BRIDE
          When do you think that might be?



                    BILL
          That my dearest, all depends on
          you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
          sarcasm.
          Least not for the first year.
          You're going to have to let him
          warm up for you. He hates
          Caucasians, despises Americans, and
          has nothing but contempt for women,
          so in your case, that may take a
          little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



                    THE BRIDE
              (yelling)
          Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          If it is Christ you seek, turn back
          now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



                     THE BRIDE *
          Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
          student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
          understand a single word you say.
          It causes my ears discomfort. You
          are not to speak unless spoken to.
          Do you understand Mandarin any
          better than you speak it?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I speak Japanese very well --



                    PAI    MEI'S VOICE *
          I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
          or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
          asked if you    understand Mandarin?



                    THE BRIDE *

          A little, I am still learning.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          You are here to learn the mysteries
          of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
          can't understand me, I will
          communicate with you like I would a
          dog. When I yell, when I point,
          When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



                    PAI MEI *
          Bill is your master, is he not?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes, he is.



                    PAI MEI *
          Your master tells me you're not
          entirely unschooled. What training
          do you possess?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I am proficient in a combination of
          Tiger and Crane style. And I am
          more than proficient in the
          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



                    PAI MEI *
              (he makes a SNORTING
               SOUND)
          The exquisite art of the samurai
          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
          called exquisite art, is only fit
          for Japanese fat heads. You really
          are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

                     PAI MEI *
           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



                     THE BRIDE *
           I'm sorry master --



                     PAI MEI *
           -- Silence! I do not wish to hear
           your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



                     PAI MEI *
           Your anger amuses me. Do you
           believe you are my match?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Are you aware I kill at will?



                       THE BRIDE *
           Yes.



                     PAI MEI *
           Is it your wish to die?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Then you must be stupid. Rise
           stupid, and let me get a better

             look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



                       PAI MEI *
             You breathe hard. The one hundred
             steps robbed you of your wind. So
             your stupidity is matched only by
             your weakness. Is there anything
             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
             Japs. I would of thought an
             American would be immune to their
             pompous posturing. Apparently I was
             wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



                       PAI MEI *
             Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



                       PAI    MEI *
             Let's see how    good you really are.
             Try and land    a blow. If you land a
             single blow,    I'll bow down and call
             you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

                    PAI MEI *
          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          an old man?

She tries more...



                    PAI MEI *
          Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



                    PAI MEI *
          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
          cripples who posed more of a
          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



                    PAI MEI *
          From here you can get an excellent
          view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



                    PAI MEI *
          Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



                    PAI MEI *
          That blade's sharp. Careful not to
          cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



                    PAI MEI *
          If you can't fight any better than
          that, what use do you have for a
          leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



                    PAI MEI *
          Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

                    PAI MEI *
          Your swordsmanship is amateur at
          best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



                    PAI MEI *
          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
          and you can't even make me break a
          sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



                    PAI MEI *
          Let's see your Tiger and Crane
          style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



                    PAI MEI *
          ...pathetic.....terrible...you
          idiot, you should've landed that
          blow...you call that crane?...
          Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



                    PAI MEI *
          I asked you to show me what you
          know, and you did. Not a goddamn
          thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



                    PAI MEI *
          Like all yankee women, the only
          thing you know how to do is order

          in restaurants and spend a man's
          money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



                    PAI MEI *
          Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
          a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



                     THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          I could chop off your arm at will.
          I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



                    THE BRIDE
          No please don't!



                    PAI MEI *
          If you wish to speak romantic
          languages, you've come to the wrong
          place.



                    THE BRIDE *
          Please don't cut my arm off!



                    PAI MEI *
          It's my arm now. I can do with it
          what I please. If you can stop me,
          I suggest you try.



                     THE BRIDE *
          I can't!

                    PAI MEI *
          Because you're helpless?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          Have you ever felt this before?



                    THE BRIDE *
          No!



                    PAI MEI *
          Compared to me you're as helpless
          as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
          you?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!!!



                    PAI MEI *
          THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



                    PAI MEI *
          Is it your wish to learn how to
          make others as helpless as you
          were?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.



                    PAI MEI *
          Can you cook?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.

                    PAI MEI *
          I'll be the judge of    that.
              (pause)
          Draw me a bath...your    training will
          begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
          mine. You may lose it    yet.

                                                   TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



                    PAI MEI *
          Since your arm now belongs to me, I
          want it strong. Can you do that?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can, but not that close.



                    PAI MEI *
          Then you can't do it.



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can put my hand through that at
          six inches.



                    PAI MEI *
          And you could shoot a man from a
          rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
          if you so desired, but this is not
          what I asked. What if your enemy is
          three inches in front of you, what
          do you do then? Curl into a ball?
          Or do you put your fist through
          him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

                         PAI MEI *
            Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



                      PAI MEI *
            If you want to eat like a dog, I
            will make you live and sleep like a
            dog. Outside. If you want to live
            and sleep like a human being, pick
            up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



                      PAI MEI *
            It's the wood that       should fear your
            hand, not the other       way around. No
            wonder you can't do       it, you
            acquiesce to defeat       before you even
            begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

                    PAI MEI *
          In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



                    PAI MEI *
          In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



                    PAI MEI *
          You are to go into that pit, and
          catch that rat, with your bare
          hands. If you catch the rat, I will
          deem you the victor, and tonight
          you will dine on bird. But, if you
          can't catch the rat by sundown,
          I'll deem the victor the rat. And
          because of the disgrace to my
          student, I will be forced to kill
          it. And then I will force you, to
          consume his body. Because to be my
          student, you must develop a taste
          for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

                     THE BRIDE *
          I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
          this rat. However, I will not eat
          this filthy vermin. What I will
          do...
              (she RIPS the rat open
                like a pomegranate)
          ...is consume his victorious heart.
              (she snatches the tiny
                heart from the rodent's
                carcass. Holding it
                between her fingers.)
          But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



                    PAI MEI *
          How does victory taste?



                       THE BRIDE *
          Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



                       THE BRIDE
                 (to herself)
          Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



                    PAI MEI *
          Woman, is that you who disturbs my
          meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

                      THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Yes, teacher.



                      PAI MEI *
            Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



                      PAI MEI *
            What news do you find so worthy, as
            to disrupt my bath?



                      THE BRIDE *
            I did it teacher. I put my fist
            through the wall.

                                                  TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



                      PAI MEI *
            Very good. Would you care to
            demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



                      THE BRIDE *
            I think you watching is making me
            nervous.



                      PAI MEI *
            Not only that, it has you speaking
            before you were spoken to. Try
            again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



                    PAI MEI
          Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



                    THE BRIDE *
          Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



                    PAI MEI *
          You still fight better than you
          speak. Finally, a woman who
          understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



                    PAI MEI *
          Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

                                                 CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



                    THE BRIDE
          I'd like a glass of water.

                                          FADE TO BLACK.

CU ELLE DRIVER
Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving
full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming

out of her powerful speakers.



EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



                    BUDD
          Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



                    ELLE
          ...So that's called a Texas
          funeral?



                    BUDD
          Yep.



                    ELLE
          I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
          a pretty fucked up way to die.
          What's the name on the grave she's
          buried under?



                    BUDD
          Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



                    ELLE

          Can I look at the sword?



                    BUDD
          That's my money in that black case,
          isn't it?



                     ELLE
          Sure is.



                    BUDD
          Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



                    ELLE
          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



                    BUDD
          That's a Hanzo sword alright.



                    ELLE
          Bill tells me you once had one of
          your own.

Pause.



                     BUDD
          Once.



                    ELLE
          How does this one compare to that
          one?



                    BUDD
          If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
          sword, you compare it to every

          sword ever made -- wasn't made by
          Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
          around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



                    BUDD
          So, which "R" you filled with?



                    ELLE
          What?



                    BUDD
          They say the number one killer of
          old people is retirement. People
          got'em a job to do, they tend to
          live a little longer so they can do
          it. I've always figured warriors
          and their enemies share the same
          relationship. So now you ain't
          gonna hafta face your enemy on the
          battlefield no more, which "R" are
          you filled with, Relief or Regret?



                    ELLE
          A little bit of both.



                     BUDD
          Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
          little bit of both. But I know damn
          well you feel one more than you
          feel the other. The question was
          which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



                    ELLE
          Regret.



                    BUDD
          Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
          girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
          Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
          Bill useta think she was so damn
          smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
          she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



                    ELLE
          Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



                    ELLE
          Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
          of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
          to introduce my friend, The Black
          Mamba.
              (gesturing towards the
               refridgerator)
          Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
          know before I picked up that little
          fella, I looked him up on the
          internet.
              (she removes her notepad
               from her pocket)

          Fascinating creature the Black
          Mamba. Listen to this,
              (reading from the notepad)
          "...In Africa, the saying goes, in
          the bush, an elephant can kill you.
          A leopard can kill you. And a Black
          Mamba can kill you. But only with
          the Mamba, and this has been true
          in Africa since the dawn of time,
          is death sure. Hence its handle;
          Death Incarnate."
              (looking up from the
               paper)
          Pretty cool, huh?
              (back to paper)
          "...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
          nature's most effective poisons,
          acting on the nervous system
          causing paralysis. The venom of a
          Black Mamba can kill a human in
          four hours, if say bitten on the
          ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
          to the face or torso can bring
          death from paralysis within twenty
          minutes.
              (up from paper to Budd)
          Now you should listen to this cause
          this concerns you.
              (reading from the paper)
          The amount of venom that can be
          delivered from a single bit can be
          gargantuan.
              (looks up from paper)
          -- You know I've always liked that
          word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
          have an opportunity to use it in a
          sentence.
              (back to paper)
          "If not treated quickly with anti
          venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
          fatal to human beings. However, the
          Black Mamba can deliver as much as
          100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
          a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



                    ELLE
          Now in these last agonizing minutes
          of life you have left, let me
          answer the question you asked
          earlier, more thoroughly. When it
          comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
          "R's" in me. Revenge is one.
          Retribution is another. Rivalry is
          definitely one. But I got another

          "R" for that bitch you might be
          surprised to find out. Respect. But
          right at this moment, the biggest
          "R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
          maybe the greatest warrior I have
          ever met, met her end at the hands
          of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
          piece of shit like you. The woman
          deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



                    ELLE
              (into phone)
          Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
          news.
              (pause)
          Your brother's dead.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



                    ELLE (CONT'D)
          She put a Black Mamba in his
          camper.
              (pause)
          I got her, sweety.
              (pause)
          She's dead.
              (pause)
          Let me put it this way. If you ever
          start feeling sentimental, go to
          Austin, Texas. When you get here,
          walk into a florist and buy a bunch
          of flowers. Then you take those
          flowers to Huntington cemetery on
          Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
          headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
          then lay them on the grave. Because
          you will be standing at the final
          resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



                    ELLE
          Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



                    ELLE
          Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see

coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



                    ELLE
          Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
          alacky had got the best of you.



                    THE BRIDE
          You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



                    ELLE
              (referring to the sword)
          What's that?

                    THE BRIDE
          Guess that makes him a liar, don't
          it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.

          Oooh, not so good.



                    ELLE
          Were I to do it over again, I'd
          bite my tongue.



                    THE BRIDE
          One more question?



                       ELLE
          Shoot.

          You wouldn't lie to me now?



                            ELLE
          Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw what you did to that little
          Mamba in there. Want to try that on
          somebody your own size?




                    ELLE
          I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



                            THE BRIDE
          Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
          we get started. Hattori Hanzo
          swords are extremely sharp. They
          can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
          Careful not to cut your own arm
          off.



                    ELLE
          I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're gonna bleed though, you're
          gonna bleed a lot.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home (named Villa
Quatro) located on the beach in Mexico. At the moment Bill
partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
          to leave now.



                    BILL
              (finishing up)
          Yes, I got to go and meet the
          Duchess.
              (referring to the flowers)
          Do you like it?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.



                    BILL
          Why don't you put it on the dinner
          table, so we can enjoy it tonight.



                    JOSEPHINA
              (she takes it)
          Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



                    BILL
          Oh and Josephina, take the
          remaining flowers and spread them
          around the house, if you would.

                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



                    BILL
          You know I just had a great idea.
          Take the roses, and spread the
          petals on the bed I just got for
          her. That'd be a nice thing to come
          home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
          roses.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.



                    BILL
          You wouldn't mind doing that for
          me, would you Josephina?



                    JOSEPHINA
          No, not at all.

A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride's Eye
every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

BILL
driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



                    THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
          The attentive    audience members
          among you will    have probably
          noticed, that    all my kills have
          been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Y'all figured I'd face him with my

          Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
          Bill figured the same thing. I am
          the product of three godfathers.
          Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
          Different teachers teach you
          different things. But one thing I
          learned from all three, was "in
          combat, the opponent that does the
          unexpected, can usually expect to
          be the victor." Bill would never
          see this coming. Not from me. And
          least any of you judge me a
          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
          who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



                    BILL
          Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Bill.



                    BILL
          Kiddo, is that really you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's me all right.



                    BILL
          I hear you were driving a truck?



                    THE BRIDE
          My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
          your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



                    BILL
          Oh, you mean the little tow head
          next to me, who looks
          extraordinarily like you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, that one.



                    BILL
          Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



                    THE BRIDE
          B.B.?



                    BILL
          Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes. Can she hear us?



                    BILL
          Not now, she's in dream land.



                    THE BRIDE
          How old is she?



                    BILL
          What do you mean by that?



                    THE BRIDE
          How many years has she been alive?

          BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



          THE BRIDE
Is she five?



          BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



          THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
    (pause)
I want to meet her.



          BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



          THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



          BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



          THE BRIDE
    (confused)
What have you told her about me?



          BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

          picture of you --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- which one?



                    BILL
          The one I took of you in Paris,
          sitting on the steps with the
          baguette in your hand. Since she
          was one and a half years old, she's
          slept with that picture of you next
          to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



                    THE BRIDE
          You know, prettier photos of me do
          exist.



                    BILL
          And she's seen them. But the one
          she wants looking after her while
          she sleeps is the one of you
          holding bread.
              (pause)
          We normally have dinner around
          seven, is that convenient?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



                    THE BRIDE
          When do we cross swords?



                    BILL
          Well, it just so happens, my
          hacienda comes with its very own
          private beach. And my private
          beach, just so happens to look
          particularly beautiful bathed in
          moonlight. And there just so
          happens to be a full moon out
          tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

          want to sword fight, that's where I
          suggest. But if you wanna be old
          school about it - then we can wait
          till dawn, and slice each other up
          at sunrise, like a couple real life
          honest to goodness samurais. As per
          usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
          decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



                    THE BRIDE
          Do me a courtesy?



                      BILL
          Anything.



                    THE BRIDE
          Slow down as we pass...I want
          another look at her.



                    BILL
          Wear something nice tonight?



                    THE BRIDE
          I have a dress all picked out.



                    BILL
          Will I like it?



                    THE BRIDE
          You said I looked beautiful last
          time you saw me in it.



                    BILL
          I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



                    THE BRIDE
          You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



                    BILL
          Now you just wait one second there
          little missy. Unless I'm confused,
          we are trying to kill each other
          aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
          taking a shot at you in front of
          the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
          if you're gonna forget everything I
          ever taught you, and gawk like you
          ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
          take a shot, am I not?



                    THE BRIDE
          Did she wake up?



                    BILL
          Of course not. She's like you that
          way.
          I look forward to this evening. It
          was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
              (in phone; groggy)
          Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Hattori!



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Beatrix, what's wrong?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

                                                 CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          Half of Bill's strength, lies in
          his talent for the unexpected.
          If you intend to vanquish this man,
          and claim your daughter, you must
          not only expect the unexpected. You
          must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Josephina.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in here and don't come out. If
          you leave this room I'll shoot you,
          comprende?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Kiddo! If you're through shooting
          the servants, I'm in the living
          room. You remember how to get to
          the living room, don'tcha? Go down
          to the end of the hall, and make a
          left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



                     BILL
              (loudly)
          Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

                    BILL
          Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



                    B.B.
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



                    BILL
          Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
          you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



                    BILL
          You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
          are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



                    BILL
          But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
          know,...that five-year-old B.B.
          Gunn was only playing possum, due
          to the fact she was impervious to
          bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



                     B.B.

              (to Mommy)
          I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



                    BILL
              (to B.B.)
          Hey, get back down there, you're
          playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



                    BILL
          So, as the smirking killer
          approached, what she thought, was a
          bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
          the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



                       B.B.
          Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



                    BILL
          Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
          known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



                    B.B.
          Don't die Mommy, I was just
          playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



                    MOMMY
          I know baby.

They embrace each other.



                    B.B.
          I waited a long time for you to
          wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
          - I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



                    THE BRIDE
          Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Now let me look at you. My my my...
          What a pretty girl you are.



                    B.B.
          You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



                       THE BRIDE
          Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



                    BILL
          When I showed you Mommy's picture,
          tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



                       BILL

          C'mon shy girl, you know what you
          said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
          fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



                    B.B.
          I said - I said - You're the most
          beautiful woman I ever saw in the
          whole white world.



                    BILL
          That's the truth. That's what she
          said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



                    B.B.
          What's that?



                    MOMMY
          Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
          dress.



                    B.B.
          Blood?



                    MOMMY
          No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



                    B.B.
          No.



                    BILL
          Do you not like it, or do you not
          know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



                    B.B.
          I do not know what it is.

                    MOMMY
          Well, it's a very tasty beverage
          that I used to drink, when I was a
          little girl. It comes in a lot of
          different flavors and colors, and
          it's really good. Maybe we should
          fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



                     BILL
          Speaking of fixing and drinking and
          eating, I think it's dinner time
          don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



                    BILL
              (to Mommy)
          When you were doin all that fancy
          shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
          a nice Mexican woman about forty
          five years old, did ya?



                    MOMMY
          No.



                     BILL
              (wiping imaginary sweat
               off his brow)
          Whew, then dinner should be done.
              (shouting to the other
               room)
          Josephina! You can come out now,
          we're ready for dinner.



                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



                    BILL
          Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



                      B.B.
          Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



                    BILL
          B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
          prettiest hair in the whole wide
          world?



                      B.B.
          Yes I do.



                    BILL
          In fact it's better than pretty.
          What's better than pretty?



                      B.B.
          Gorgeous.



                    BILL
          Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
          gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



                    BILL
          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
          Daddy.



                      B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



          BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
    (to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
    (to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



          B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



          BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



          B.B.
I stepped on him.



          BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



          B.B.
Yeah.



           BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
    (beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



          B.B.
He was -- flapping.



          BILL
And then you stomped on him?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



           B.B.
Nothing.



          BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
What did that mean?

          B.B.
He was dead.



          BILL
    (to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
    (to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



            B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



          B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



          BILL
Worse.
    (making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



            B.B.
Why?



          BILL
I don't know.



          B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



            BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



          B.B.
What happened?

                    BILL
          I was very sad. And that was when I
          learned, somethings once you do,
          they can never be undone.



                    B.B.
          What happened to Mommy?



                    BILL
          Why don't you ask Mommy.



                    B.B.
          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



                    BILL
          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



                    B.B.
          Did it make you sick?



                    MOMMY
          It put me to sleep. That's why I
          haven't been with you B.B., I've
          been asleep.



                    B.B.
          But you're awake now, right?



                    MOMMY
          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



                    BILL
          Did she go to sleep easy?



                    THE BRIDE
          It took her a little bit. She was
          excited. She's quite the little
          chatterbox.



                    BILL
          Well, if she doesn't like you, you
          got to kill her to say hello. But
          if she likes you, you can't shut
          her up. She's a chip off the ole
          blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



                      BILL
          Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



                    BILL
          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
          fun with a couple glasses of wine
          in ya.

She gives him a look.



                    BILL
              (pointing towards the
               beach)
          We're going to go out there and
          have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



                    BILL
          Well, I've already had    a glass. So
          unless you want to win    by an unfair
          advantage, you should    have a glass
          of wine. So we're both    on the same
          footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



                    BILL
          You know, there's an old man down
          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
          He was a pimp. I knew him when I
          was a child. He was a friend of my
          mother's. I told him about you.
          When I showed him your picture he
          smiles and said;
              (imitating his accent)
          "Yesss, I see the attraction." He
          told me a story about taking me to
          the movies when I was five. It was
          a movie which had Lana Turner in
          it. And whenever she would appear
          on screen, he said I would stick my
          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
          an obscure amount. And he knew
          right then, this boy will be a fool
          for blondes.



                    THE BRIDE
          Who would of ever thought you'd be
          such a good father?



                    BILL
          Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



                    THE BRIDE
          Must we have to endure your little
          zingers?



                    BILL
          No we mustn't. But if you're going
          to say sentences like that, in the
          future, I will resist the
          temptation.



                    THE BRIDE
          Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

                    BILL
          I sent you to L.A. and you never
          came back. I thought you'd been
          killed. Do you know how cruel it is
          to make someone think someone they
          love is dead? I mourned you. Then
          in the third month of my mourning,
          I track you down. I wasn't trying
          to track you down, I was trying to
          track down - the fucking assholes -
          who I thought killed you. And when
          I find you, what to I find? Not
          only are you not dead, you're
          getting married - to some fuckin
          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
          you expect me to react?



                    THE BRIDE
          Why do you think I hid?



                    BILL
          Why did you leave in the first
          place? You have cold eyes towards
          me now. I understand their
          temperature, but they were warm the
          second to the last time I saw them,
          or was that just my imagination?



                       THE BRIDE
          No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          You sent me to L.A. to kill that
          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



                    BILL (ENGLISH)
          You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



          BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



          THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



          BILL
But you never did.



          THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



          BILL
My apologies, please continue.



          THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

          kill me in my hotel room. As I was
          dancing in euphoria, the killer
          came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello, can I help you?



                    HOTEL WOMAN
          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
          hospitality manager of the hotel. I
          have a welcome gift from the
          management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
          busy at this second, could you
          possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



                    KAREN
          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
          to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



                    THE BRIDE
          Wait a second!

Karen stops.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
          come here to kill your sister. But
          I'm not gonna do that now.



                    KAREN
          Oh, I know you're not --



                    THE BRIDE
          - listen to me! I just found out,
          right now - not two minutes before
          you blew a hole in the door, I'm
          pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



                    THE BRIDE
          On that table is the    home pregnancy
          kit. On the floor by    the door is
          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
          want to and I won't    kill your
          sister. I just want    to go home.

                    KAREN
          What is this, bullshit story number
          twelve in the female assassin's
          handbook?



                    THE BRIDE
          Any other time you'd be a hundred
          percent right. But this time you're
          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
          deadliest woman in the world, but
          right now I'm scared shitless for
          my baby. Please, you hafta believe
          me. Look at the strip, it's on the
          floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



                    KAREN
          Sit down on that bed and put your
          hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Blue means pregnant.



                    KAREN
          I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



                     KAREN
          Okay, say I were to believe you,
          what then?



                    THE BRIDE
          Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

                    KAREN
          You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



                    THE BRIDE
          Facing Karen Wong, was the most
          frightening moment I have ever
          experienced. And that includes
          three years with that evil bastard
          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
          blue, I was a woman, I was your
          woman. I was a killer, who killed
          for you. Before that strip turned
          blue, I would have jumped a
          motorcycle on to a speeding train
          ...for you. But once that strip
          turned blue, I could no longer do
          any of those things. Not anymore.
          Because now I was a mother. A
          mother who only had one thought on
          her mind. Please don't harm my
          baby. Can you understand that?



                    BILL
          Yes. But why tell me now, and not
          then?



                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't have let me go.
          Specially once you found out I was
          pregnant. You would've tried to
          talk me out of it. It would have
          been a big scene. I just said fuck
          it.

Starting to get mad.



                       BILL
          Fuck who?



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, you couldn't know I was
          pregnant, once you knew, you'd
          claim it, and I didn't want that.

                    BILL
          That's not your decision to make.



                     THE BRIDE
          Yes, but it's the right decision.
          And I made it for my daughter.
          Everybody on this earth deserves to
          start with a clean slate. But with
          us - my daughter would be born into
          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
          her of the one thing everybody
          deserves. She would be born with
          blood stains. I had to choose. I
          chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



                     THE BRIDE
          You know five years ago, if I had
          to make a list of impossible things
          that could never happen.
          You performing a coup de grace on
          me by bustin a cap in my crown,
          would be right at the top of the
          list.
              (beat)
          I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



                    BILL
          I'm sorry was that a question? Of
          impossible things that could never
          happen - yes in this instance you
          would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



                       THE BRIDE
          Well?



                       BILL
          Well what?



                    THE BRIDE
          Explain yourself.

                    BILL
          I already have. When I told you the
          story of when I thought you were
          dead. Didn't you get how badly I
          felt?



                    THE BRIDE
          You call that an explanation?



                     BILL
          Well if that's too cryptic let's
          get literal.
              (beat)
          There are consequences to breaking
          the heart of a murdering bastard.
          You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



                    THE BRIDE
          You and I have unfinished business.



                    BILL
          Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



                     BILL
          You know how proud I am of you,
          don't you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.



                     BILL
          You know I was rooting for you,
          don't you?

                       THE BRIDE
          I figured.



                    BILL
          You know on that beach out there I
          want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



                    BILL
          You also know you're going to have
          to defeat me. I can't just give it
          to you, even though I want to.



                    THE BRIDE
          It won't be necessary for you to
          give me anything. I've surpassed
          you. I'll take it.



                    BILL
          Well, as they say in Missouri, show
          me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



                       THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



                    BILL
              (to himself)
          That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



                       BILL

          He taught you the ten point palm
          exploding heart technique?



                    THE BRIDE
          Of course he did.



                    BILL
          Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't know...Because...I'm
          a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



                    BILL
          No. You're not a bad person. You're
          a terrific person. You're my
          favorite person. But every once in
          awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.
